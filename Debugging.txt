Debugging Guide for Cypress Framework
This document provides guidance on how to approach debugging the intentional issues in this Cypress framework and implementing the Page Object Model (POM) using AI assistance.
Debugging Approach
When debugging the Cypress framework, consider following these steps:
The framework contains several intentional syntax and logical errors that are not straightforward to fix. These issues simulate real-world problems that developers might encounter when working with Cypress. To effectively debug these issues, follow this systematic approach:
Run the tests first to identify failures. Start by running the Cypress tests to see what errors occur. This will give you a starting point for debugging.
Read error messages carefully. Cypress usually provides detailed error messages that can point you to the source of the problem. Pay close attention to line numbers and error descriptions.
Check configuration files. Many test failures can be caused by incorrect configuration. Review the cypress.config.js file for any potential issues with settings like timeouts, viewport dimensions, or other configuration parameters.
Inspect custom commands. Custom commands in the support files can cause subtle issues if they're not implemented correctly. Review the commands.js file for any syntax errors or logical problems.
Review test syntax. Cypress has specific syntax requirements for its commands and assertions. Look for issues with command chaining, selector syntax, and assertion methods in the test files.
Use AI assistance effectively. When you encounter an issue:
Provide the AI with the specific error message and relevant code
Ask targeted questions about the potential cause
Request explanations of correct Cypress syntax and patterns
Have the AI review your fixes to ensure they're correct
Fix one issue at a time. Addressing multiple issues simultaneously can lead to confusion. Fix one problem, run the tests again, and then move on to the next issue.
Document your fixes. Keep track of the issues you find and how you resolve them. This will help you learn from the debugging process and share knowledge with your team.

Implementing Page Object Model (POM) with AI

After debugging the framework, you'll want to implement the Page Object Model pattern to improve test maintainability. Here's how to approach this with AI assistance:
The Page Object Model (POM) is a design pattern that creates an object repository for web UI elements. It helps reduce code duplication and improves test maintenance. To implement POM in your Cypress framework using AI:
Understand POM fundamentals. The Page Object Model separates page-specific code from test logic:
Each page or component gets its own class
The class contains methods that perform actions on that page
Tests import and use these page objects instead of directly interacting with elements
Plan your page structure. Identify the pages or components in your application that need page objects. Common examples include:
Login page
Navigation menu
Dashboard
Forms or specific functional areas
Create a basic page object structure. Ask the AI to help you create a template for your page objects. A typical structure includes:
Element selectors
Methods for actions (click, type, etc.)
Methods for assertions
Navigation methods
Use AI to generate page objects. Provide the AI with:
The HTML structure of the page
The actions that need to be performed
Any existing test code that interacts with the page
